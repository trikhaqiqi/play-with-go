 * for is Go’s only looping construct. Here are some basic types of for loops.
 * The most basic type, with a single condition.
 * A classic initial/condition/after for loop.
 * Another way of accomplishing the basic “do this N times” iteration is range over an integer.
 * for without a condition will loop repeatedly until you break out of the loop or return from the enclosing function.
 * You can also continue to the next iteration of the loop.
