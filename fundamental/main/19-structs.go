/**
 * Go’s structs are typed collections of fields. They’re useful for grouping data together to form records.
 * This person struct type has name and age fields.
 * newPerson constructs a new person struct with the given name.
 * You can safely return a pointer to local variable as a local variable will survive the scope of the function.
 * This syntax creates a new struct.
 * You can name the fields when initializing a struct.
 * Omitted fields will be zero-valued.
 * An & prefix yields a pointer to the struct.
 * It’s idiomatic to encapsulate new struct creation in constructor functions
 * Access struct fields with a dot.
 * You can also use dots with struct pointers - the pointers are automatically dereferenced.
 * Structs are mutable.
 * If a struct type is only used for a single value, we don’t have to give it a name. The value can have an anonymous struct type. This technique is commonly used for table-driven tests.
