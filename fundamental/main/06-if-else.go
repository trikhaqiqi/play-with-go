/**
 * Branching with if and else in Go is straight-forward.
 * Here’s a basic example.
 * You can have an if statement without an else.
 * Logical operators like && and || are often useful in conditions.
 * A statement can precede conditionals; any variables declared in this statement are available in the current and all subsequent branches.
 * Note that you don’t need parentheses around conditions in Go, but that the braces are required.
 * There is no ternary if in Go, so you’ll need to use a full if statement even for basic conditions.
